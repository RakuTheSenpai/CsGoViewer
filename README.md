# CsGoViewer
CsGoViewer allows you to see your inventory from the Go with most of the functionality that the in-game inventory has and a similar look. The process is really simple and you can even check other inventories! 
## Instalation
Unfortunately, I'm not able to host the website so you'll have to clone the repository and run the app with.

## Enter a steamID
You need to provide a steam id or a public steam profile in order to retrieve the inventory.

## Filtering and Sorting
You can choose from the following sorting and filtering options, an empty page will appear if your inventory does not contain any of the specified by the filtering. (Let me know if the items displayed are different than the ones in the game).
